##  Overview

The Autonomous Cyber Incident Response Bot is an intelligent cybersecurity automation system designed to detect, analyze, and respond to potential cyber threats in real time. It acts like a digital security analyst — continuously monitoring system activities, identifying anomalies, and executing response actions automatically. Using machine learning, rule-based detection, and automated scripts, this bot minimizes response time during cyber incidents and reduces the workload on human security teams.y

##  Features

- Cross-platform support (Linux & Windows)
- Real-time threat monitoring using file watching or Windows Event Log queries
- Configurable thresholds and time windows for detection
- Simulates IP blocking on detection
- Alert Reporting
- Detects anomalies based on behavioral patterns.

## What This Does

-Monitors systems for malicious activity or policy violations.

-Automatically investigates, classifies, and responds to detected incidents.

-Executes real-time defensive actions such as isolating affected systems or blocking IPs.

-Reduces response time and enhances overall cyber resilience.
